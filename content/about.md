I‚Äôm a dad and a technologist by heart. I love creating things which help people.

I started out by breaking computers at home, after that I became a software engineer and quickly moved to lead technical teams and found a comfortable position as both a hands-on and a communicative technical leader.

### Life's goals
I've set a goal in life that I'd like to help/inspire 100 people in a significant way. I find it inspirational to set challenges for myself and try to achieve and reflect on them.

### Contacting me
Feel free to e-mail me at mark@dynom.nl or find me on one of the social networks I'm on.
